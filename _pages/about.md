Hi! Glad to meet you here. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D degree in Big Data and Social Computing (BDSC) lab under the supervision of Professor Philip S. Yu at University of Illinois Chicago. Previouly, I accomplished my bachelor degree from the University of Glasgow and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2022.

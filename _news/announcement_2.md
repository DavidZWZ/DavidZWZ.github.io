:tada: :tada: :tada: Our paper [LightGODE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18910) has been accepted in [CIKM 2024](https://cikm2024.org/). 
In this work we challenge the necessity of graph convolution in the recommender systems and proposed a Light Post-Training Graph Ordinary-Differential-Equation for extremely efficient recommendation.
